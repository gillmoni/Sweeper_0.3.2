DEVELOPER NOTES
---------------

If you are a developer interested in contributing to Sweeper then there are a few things to note
before you jump in and start coding. First be sure to read this overview - http://goo.gl/mlPff

The **master** branch will always be the latest stable release of the app so unless you
like living life dangerously this is the best place to start:

    $ git clone git://github.com/ushahidi/Sweeper.git

With the app code checked out you still need to perform the following steps before you can
start local development:

    $ cd Sweeper
    $ git submodule init
    $ git submodule update

Why do we do this? Well, Sweeper is just one of many applications that run on the [Swiftriver](http://github.com/ushahidi/Swiftriver)
core framework. To allow for this, the framework has its own repository and is brought into
this project using the [**git-submodule**](http://chrisjean.com/2009/04/20/git-submodules-adding-using-removing-and-updating/)
facility.

Once you have done this, you will have all the code required to run and change Sweeper!
